# DankTimesBot-Plugin-Items
An items and shop plugin for the DankTimesBot. Very much WIP.

## TODO:
1. Implement usage of the various flags given to Item
2. Round calculated prices to max 3 non-0 numbers so they look better (e.g. 35748 becomes 35700)

## Installation

1. Git clone this repository into your DankTimesBot/plugins directory or unzip it in there;
2. Add `DankTimesBot-Plugin-Items` to your `/data/config.json`'s plugins list;
3. Re-launch DankTimesBot.

## Usage

Send the `/items` command to the bot to receive help.
